Lab 1 takes a postfix expression and outputs instructions for evalutating the expression. It also contains a stack class that I made. 
Lab 2 works with the Stack.java file. It solve the Towers of Hannoi iteratively and recursively. 
Lab 3 goes with the List, Node, and Tree files. It creates a Huffman Encoding tree and can encode and decode strings.
Lab 4 sorts input using quicksorts with different pivots and with heap sort.
Assignment 4 creates calendars either for the month or year specified by the user. It works with the getStartDay, but I did not write that class, it was provided with the assignment.
